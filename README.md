# Case Notes (Web version)

Case notes serve as a running record of client contact as well as a location to keep track of any client information relevant to their treatment. Case managers are dedicated to serving the ever-changing requirements of their clients. As a result, case managers will keep track of clientsâ€™ progress, goals, and treatment responses in a case note.
